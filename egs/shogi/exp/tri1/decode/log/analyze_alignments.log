The optional-silence phone sil occupies 11.3% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 80.5% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 7.2% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.8 hours of data, or 0.7 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 17.3% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (8,8.5,25)
