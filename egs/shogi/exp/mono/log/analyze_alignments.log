The optional-silence phone sil occupies 7.3% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 83.3% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 6.9% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 7.3 hours of data, or 6.8 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 16.2% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (8,8.8,24)
